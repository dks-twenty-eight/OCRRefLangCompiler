# A Compiler For The OCR Reference Language

A personal project to 
* practise programming in Haskell
* do something interesting
* be able to run programs presented in OCR exams without translating into another programming language first.

The compiler will produce a binary that will require running on a run-time (conceptually, therefore, a type of ByteCode), an implementation of which will be written in Rust in a separate project. This project is currently in the planning stage; version `0.1.0.1` will include a function to convert an input file into a list of lexical tokens using regular expressions.
